# Objectiv Blog Builder
Objectiv Blog Builder is a simple plugin that allows you to add different components to your blog post via shortcodes. It is meant for creating stylised blog posts similar to [this](http://brothersandcraft.com/logbook/people-of-richmond-highpoint-barber-shop). Objectiv Blog Builder is meant to make it easier to create beautiful and consistent posts without having to use a ton of different plugins and without having to configure a ton of different options.

**Warning:** This plugin does create shortcodes to display the components. If you deactivate the plugin, the shortcodes will no longer be useable.
